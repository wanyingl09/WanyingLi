# Discoveries

* href="../static/style.css" is how we linked the css to the HTML
* leaving it as href="style.css" doesn't work - the css isn't rendered on the website but it still loads the HTML
* .. means the previous directory
* loading files is like a directory system from the HTML document as the root
* how to format code in VSCODE -> sent to the QAF

# Questions

* can an absolute path work for linking external CSS files?
* why is the HTML document the root when linking, instead of the repo or the folders that it is in?
