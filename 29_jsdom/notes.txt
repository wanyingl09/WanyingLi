QCC:
- piazza post @629 mentioned class order doesn't matter for the colors because it's based on the order of the stylesheet
- tested it out and it's true
- response to our piazza post:
var dasbut = document.getElementById("b"); 
dasbut.addEventListener('click', ()=>{
	console.log(fib(20))
});
- anonymous function?
