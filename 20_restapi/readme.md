# Discoveries

* resources in the notes and code's readme are very helpful
* gitignore to avoid tracking the API KEY entirely
* img can render images hosted on external websites
* req.json() to get the json format of the request - easy for parsing like a dictionary

# Questions

* how to make a post request instead of get?
* how do we parse HTML and XML responses?
* why does the request also show the date?

# Comments
* the image is TOO high resolution

# Concerns
* will a star hit us!?!?!?!? will we become 200,000 degrees C?!!??!?! oh god!
