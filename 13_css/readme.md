#Discoveries:
* padding adds "comfort" for tags, giving them space to breathe a little bit
* Indenting is very useful for reading html files and identifying where things may go wrong
* The asterisk is used to select all elements in an html
* CSS is linked to HTML externally from the code through "link rel"

#Questions:
* how to apply padding to an entire section
