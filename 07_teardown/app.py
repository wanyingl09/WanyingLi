    # Q0: Where have you seen similar syntax in other langs?
        # I've seen it in Discord for underlining and italcizing words. markdown 

@app.route("/")
    # Q1: What points of reference do you have for meaning of '/'?
        # Signals file location 

def hello_world():
    print(__name__)
        # Q2: Where will this print to?
            # Terminal 
        # Q3: What will it print?
            # "name" all italicized
    return "No hablo queso!"
        # Q4: Will this appear anywhere? How u know?
            # Where the app is directed to because it is returned rather than printed. We also followed the link. 

app.run()
# Q5: Where have you seen similar constructs in other languages?
    #Java my love <3

DISCO:
- Flask will link links
- Rout not root

QCC:
0. Where is this hosted  
1. Where is name printed???? 
2. Why is "__name__" in Flask and also printed?? Do these mean anything. Is it connected?   
3. Where is it routing to?? Why use the "@" symbol 
4. Why does it use Java syntax 
5. Why is flask imported with "__name__", what "__name__" even mean??? 
...
INVESTIGATIVE APPROACH:
We used out previous coding knowledge as well as any other knowledge. Then we tested out the code to see if what we did was right.
